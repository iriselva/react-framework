# Module 6 React Framework
## Mini Portfolio

For this project I used Next.js, Prismic Database and Vercel. Next.js is a React Framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites. Prismic holds the database where I logged in all of my projects. It is then all deployed with Vercel.

I decided to make a mini Portfolio displaying my personal and collaboration projects. Each project then has a link to their github repository and also the live version. Today the styling is mininmal but hopefully more design and other elements will be implimented in the future.

I hope you like it!
